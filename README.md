Image Correlation Spectroscopy (Pearson correlation based)

This Jupyter Notebook was written to analyze cluster sizes of proten 3A for the paper of Voss et al. 2022 (FEBS Journal). 
Specifically auto-correlation based image correlation spectroscopy (Pearson correlation based) was applied to images from confocal microscopy.
This Jupyter Notebook is suited for auto-correlation and cross-correlation studies. A detailled methodical description can be found in the methods section of Voss et al.
