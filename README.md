# ImageCorrelationSpectroscopy
Spatial image Correlation Spectroscopy (Pearson correlation based)

This Jupyter Notebook was written to analyze cluster sizes of proten 3A for the paper of Voss et al. 2022 (FEBS Journal, https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.16368). 
Specifically auto-correlation based spatial image correlation spectroscopy (Pearson correlation based) was applied to images from confocal microscopy.
This Jupyter Notebook is suited for auto-correlation and cross-correlation studies. A detailled methodical description can be found in the methods section of Voss et al.
